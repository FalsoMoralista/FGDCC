# TODO: here we will call the train method from FAISS and the update method implemented by us.
# we will profile the running time (cpu vs single-gpu), compare the difference between centroids obtained 
# by each method, the difference between assignments and inertia. 
# 

# (1) - create two faiss objects with gpu environment setup .
# (2) - load cached features and call both methods. 
# 


# TODO:
# Rodar 5x cada método (FAISS vs nosso) e comparar resultados para centroids aleatórias.
